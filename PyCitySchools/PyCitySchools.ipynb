    "This Dataset analises all schools and all students within the Local Government Area (LGA). It will firstly summarise the entire dataset which will show that we are spending nearly $25M on 39,107 students. Hopefully by using this data analysis, we can better alocate funding and resources to schools within the LGA.\n",
